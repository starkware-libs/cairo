[#IGovernor-Functions]
==== Functions

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-name]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++name++#++() → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Name of the governor instance (used in building the {SNIP-12} domain separator).

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-version]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++version++#++() → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Version of the governor instance (used in building {SNIP-12} domain separator).

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-COUNTING_MODE]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++COUNTING_MODE++#++() → ByteArray++` [.item-kind]#external#

A description of the possible `support` values for `cast_vote` and the way these votes are counted, meant to be consumed by UIs
to show correct vote options and interpret the results. The string is a URL-encoded sequence of key-value pairs
that each describe one aspect, for example `support=bravo&quorum=for,abstain`.

There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`.

- `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in
`GovernorBravo`.
- `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum.
- `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.

If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params`
key with a unique name that describes the behavior. For example:

- `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between
for/against/abstain.
- `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.

NOTE: The string can be decoded by the standard https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams[`URLSearchParams`]
JavaScript class.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-hash_proposal]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++hash_proposal++#++(calls: Span<Call>, description_hash: felt252) → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Hashing function used to (re)build the proposal id from the proposal details.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-state]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++state++#++(proposal_id: felt252) → ProposalState++` [.item-kind]#external#

Returns the state of a proposal, given its id.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-proposal_threshold]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++proposal_threshold++#++() → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

The number of votes required in order for a voter to become a proposer.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-proposal_snapshot]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++proposal_snapshot++#++(proposal_id: felt252) → u64++` [.item-kind]#external#

Timepoint used to retrieve user's votes and quorum. If using block number, the snapshot is performed at the
end of this block. Hence, voting for this proposal starts at the beginning of the following block.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-proposal_deadline]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++proposal_deadline++#++(proposal_id: felt252) → u64++` [.item-kind]#external#

Timepoint at which votes close. If using block number, votes close at the end of this block, so
it is possible to cast a vote during this block.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-proposal_proposer]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++proposal_proposer++#++(proposal_id: felt252) → ContractAddress++` [.item-kind]#external#

The account that created a proposal.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-proposal_eta]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++proposal_eta++#++(proposal_id: felt252) → u64++` [.item-kind]#external#

The time when a queued proposal becomes executable ("ETA"). Unlike `proposal_snapshot` and
`proposal_deadline`, this doesn't use the governor clock, and instead relies on the
executor's clock which may be different. In most cases this will be a timestamp.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-proposal_needs_queuing]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++proposal_needs_queuing++#++(proposal_id: felt252) → bool++` [.item-kind]#external#

Whether a proposal needs to be queued before execution. This indicates if the proposal needs to go through a timelock.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-voting_delay]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++voting_delay++#++() → u64++` [.item-kind]#external#

Delay between when a proposal is created and when the vote starts. The unit this duration is expressed in
depends on the clock (see {ERC-6372}) this contract uses.

This can be increased to leave time for users to buy voting power, or delegate it, before the voting of a proposal starts.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-voting_period]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++voting_period++#++() → u64++` [.item-kind]#external#

Delay between when a vote starts and when it ends. The unit this duration is expressed in depends on
the clock (see {ERC-6372}) this contract uses.

NOTE: The `voting_delay` can delay the start of the vote. This must be considered when
setting the voting duration compared to the voting delay.

NOTE: This value is stored when the proposal is submitted so that possible changes to the
value do not affect proposals that have already been submitted.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-quorum]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++quorum++#++(timepoint: u64) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Minimum number of votes required for a proposal to be successful.

NOTE: The `timepoint` parameter corresponds to the snapshot used for counting vote. This
allows the quorum to scale depending on values such as the total supply of a token at this
timepoint.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-get_votes]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++get_votes++#++(account: ContractAddress, timepoint: u64) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Returns the voting power of an `account` at a specific `timepoint`.

NOTE: This can be implemented in a number of ways, for example by reading the delegated
balance from one (or multiple) `ERC20Votes` tokens.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-get_votes_with_params]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++get_votes_with_params++#++(account: ContractAddress, timepoint: u64, params: Span<felt252>) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Returns the voting power of an `account` at a specific `timepoint`, given additional encoded parameters.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-has_voted]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++has_voted++#++(proposal_id: felt252, account: ContractAddress) → bool++` [.item-kind]#external#

Returns whether an `account` has cast a vote on a proposal.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-propose]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++propose++#++(calls: Span<Call>, description: ByteArray) → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Creates a new proposal. Vote starts after a delay specified by `voting_delay` and lasts for a duration specified by `voting_period`.

NOTE: The state of the Governor and targets may change between the proposal creation and its execution.
This may be the result of third party actions on the targeted contracts, or other governor proposals.
For example, the balance of this contract could be updated or its access control permissions may be
modified, possibly compromising the proposal's ability to execute successfully (e.g. the governor
doesn't have enough value to cover a proposal with multiple transfers).

Returns the id of the proposal.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-queue]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++queue++#++(calls: Span<Call>, description_hash: felt252) → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Queue a proposal. Some governors require this step to be performed before execution can
happen. If queuing is not necessary, this function may revert.

Queuing a proposal requires the quorum to be reached, the vote to be successful, and the
deadline to be reached.

Returns the id of the proposal.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-execute]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++execute++#++(calls: span<Call>, description_hash: felt252) → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Execute a successful proposal. This requires the quorum to be reached, the vote to be
successful, and the deadline to be reached. Depending on the governor it might also be
required that the proposal was queued and that some delay passed.

NOTE: Some modules can modify the requirements for execution, for example by adding an
additional timelock (See `timelock_controller`).

Returns the id of the proposal.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-cancel]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++cancel++#++(calls: Span<Call>, description_hash: felt252) → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Cancel a proposal. A proposal is cancellable by the proposer, but only while it is Pending
state, i.e. before the vote starts.

Returns the id of the proposal.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-cast_vote]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++cast_vote++#++(proposal_id: felt252, support: u8) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Cast a vote on a proposal.

Returns the weight of the vote.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-cast_vote_with_reason]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++cast_vote_with_reason++#++(proposal_id: felt252, support: u8, reason: ByteArray) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Cast a vote on a proposal with a `reason`.

Returns the weight of the vote.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-cast_vote_with_reason_and_params]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++cast_vote_with_reason_and_params++#++(proposal_id: felt252, support: u8, reason: ByteArray, params: Span<felt252>) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Cast a vote on a proposal with a reason and additional encoded parameters.

Returns the weight of the vote.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-cast_vote_by_sig]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++cast_vote_by_sig++#++(proposal_id: felt252, support: u8, voter: ContractAddress, signature: Span<felt252>) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Cast a vote on a proposal using the voter's signature.

Returns the weight of the vote.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-cast_vote_with_reason_and_params_by_sig]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++cast_vote_with_reason_and_params_by_sig++#++(proposal_id: felt252, support: u8, voter: ContractAddress, reason: ByteArray, params: Span<felt252>, signature: Span<felt252>) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Cast a vote on a proposal with a reason and additional encoded parameters using the ``voter``'s signature.

Returns the weight of the vote.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-nonces]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++nonces++#++(voter: ContractAddress) → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Returns the next unused nonce for an address.

[.contract-item]
[[IGovernor-relay]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++relay++#++(call: Call)++` [.item-kind]#external#

Relays a transaction or function call to an arbitrary target.

In cases where the governance executor is some contract other than the governor itself, like
when using a timelock, this function can be invoked in a governance proposal to recover
tokens that were sent to the governor contract by mistake.

NOTE: If the executor is simply the governor itself, use of `relay` is redundant.

- `Active`: The proposal is active.
- `Canceled`: The proposal has been canceled.
- `Defeated`: The proposal has been defeated.

[[GovernorComponent-GovernorExecutionTrait-executor]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++executor++#++(self: @ContractState) → ContractAddress++` [.item-kind]#internal#

Must return the address through which the governor executes action.
Should be used to specify whether the module execute actions through another contract
such as a timelock.

NOTE: MUST be the governor itself, or an instance of TimelockController with the
governor as the only proposer, canceller, and executor.

WARNING: When the executor is not the governor itself (i.e. a timelock), it can call
functions that are restricted with the `assert_only_governance` guard, and also
potentially execute transactions on behalf of the governor. Because of this, this module
is designed to work with the TimelockController as the unique potential external
executor.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-GovernorExecutionTrait-execute_operations]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++execute_operations++#++(ref self: ContractState, proposal_id: felt252, calls: Span<Call>)++` [.item-kind]#internal#

Execution mechanism. Can be used to modify the way operations are executed (for example adding a vault/timelock).

[[GovernorComponent-GovernorExecutionTrait-queue_operations]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++queue_operations++#++(ref self: ContractState, proposal_id: felt252, calls: Span<Call>)++` [.item-kind]#internal#

Queuing mechanism. Can be used to modify the way queuing is
performed (for example adding a vault/timelock).

Requirements:

- Must return a timestamp that describes the expected ETA for execution. If the returned
value is 0, the core will consider queueing did not succeed, and the public `queue`
function will revert.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-COUNTING_MODE]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++COUNTING_MODE++#++() → ByteArray++` [.item-kind]#external#

A description of the possible `support` values for `cast_vote` and the way these votes are counted, meant to be consumed by UIs
to show correct vote options and interpret the results. The string is a URL-encoded sequence of key-value pairs
that each describe one aspect, for example `support=bravo&quorum=for,abstain`.

There are 2 standard keys: `support` and `quorum`.

- `support=bravo` refers to the vote options 0 = Against, 1 = For, 2 = Abstain, as in
`GovernorBravo`.
- `quorum=bravo` means that only For votes are counted towards quorum.
- `quorum=for,abstain` means that both For and Abstain votes are counted towards quorum.

If a counting module makes use of encoded `params`, it should  include this under a `params`
key with a unique name that describes the behavior. For example:

- `params=fractional` might refer to a scheme where votes are divided fractionally between
for/against/abstain.
- `params=erc721` might refer to a scheme where specific NFTs are delegated to vote.

NOTE: The string can be decoded by the standard https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams[`URLSearchParams`]
JavaScript class.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-hash_proposal]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++hash_proposal++#++(calls: Span<Call>, description_hash: felt252) → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Hashing function used to (re)build the proposal id from the proposal details.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-state]]

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-proposal_snapshot]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++proposal_snapshot++#++(proposal_id: felt252) → u64++` [.item-kind]#external#

Timepoint used to retrieve user's votes and quorum. If using block number, the snapshot is performed at the
end of this block. Hence, voting for this proposal starts at the beginning of the following block.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-proposal_deadline]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++proposal_deadline++#++(proposal_id: felt252) → u64++` [.item-kind]#external#

Timepoint at which votes close. If using block number, votes close at the end of this block, so
it is possible to cast a vote during this block.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-proposal_proposer]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++proposal_proposer++#++(proposal_id: felt252) → ContractAddress++` [.item-kind]#external#

The account that created a proposal.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-proposal_eta]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++proposal_eta++#++(proposal_id: felt252) → u64++` [.item-kind]#external#

The time when a queued proposal becomes executable ("ETA"). Unlike `proposal_snapshot` and
`proposal_deadline`, this doesn't use the governor clock, and instead relies on the
executor's clock which may be different. In most cases this will be a timestamp.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-proposal_needs_queuing]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++proposal_needs_queuing++#++(proposal_id: felt252) → bool++` [.item-kind]#external#

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-voting_delay]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++voting_delay++#++() → u64++` [.item-kind]#external#

Delay between when a proposal is created and when the vote starts. The unit this duration is expressed in
depends on the clock (see {ERC-6372}) this contract uses.

This can be increased to leave time for users to buy voting power, or delegate it, before the voting of a proposal starts.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-voting_period]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++voting_period++#++() → u64++` [.item-kind]#external#

Delay between the vote start and vote end. The unit this duration is expressed in depends on
the clock (see {ERC-6372}) this contract uses.

NOTE: The `voting_delay` can delay the start of the vote. This must be considered when
setting the voting duration compared to the voting delay.

NOTE: This value is stored when the proposal is submitted so that possible changes to the
value do not affect proposals that have already been submitted.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-quorum]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++quorum++#++(timepoint: u64) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Minimum number of votes required for a proposal to be successful.

NOTE: The `timepoint` parameter corresponds to the snapshot used for counting vote. This
allows the quorum to scale depending on values such as the total supply of a token at this
timepoint.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-get_votes]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++get_votes++#++(account: ContractAddress, timepoint: u64) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Returns the voting power of an `account` at a specific `timepoint`.

NOTE: This can be implemented in a number of ways, for example by reading the delegated
balance from one (or multiple) `ERC20Votes` tokens.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-get_votes_with_params]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++get_votes_with_params++#++(account: ContractAddress, timepoint: u64, params: Span<felt252>) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Returns the voting power of an account at a specific timepoint, given additional encoded parameters.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-has_voted]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++has_voted++#++(proposal_id: felt252, account: ContractAddress) → bool++` [.item-kind]#external#

Returns whether an account has cast a vote on a proposal.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-propose]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++propose++#++(calls: Span<Call>, description: ByteArray) → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Creates a new proposal. Voting starts after the delay specified by `voting_delay` and
lasts for a duration specified by `voting_period`. Returns the id of the proposal.

This function has opt-in frontrunning protection, described in
`is_valid_description_for_proposer`.

NOTE: The state of the Governor and targets may change between the proposal creation
and its execution. This may be the result of third party actions on the targeted
contracts, or other governor proposals. For example, the balance of this contract could
be updated or its access control permissions may be modified, possibly compromising the
proposal's ability to execute successfully (e.g. the governor doesn't have enough value
to cover a proposal with multiple transfers).

Requirements:

- The proposer must be authorized to submit the proposal.
- The proposer must have enough votes to submit the proposal if `proposal_threshold` is
greater than zero.
- The proposal must not already exist.

Emits a {ProposalCreated} event.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-queue]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++queue++#++(calls: Span<Call>, description_hash: felt252) → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Queues a proposal. Some governors require this step to be performed before execution can
happen. If queuing is not necessary, this function may revert.
Queuing a proposal requires the quorum to be reached, the vote to be successful, and the
deadline to be reached.

Returns the id of the proposal.

Requirements:

- The proposal must be in the `Succeeded` state.
- The queue operation must return a non-zero ETA.

Emits a {ProposalQueued} event.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-execute]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++execute++#++(calls: span<Call>, description_hash: felt252) → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Executes a successful proposal. This requires the quorum to be reached, the vote to be
successful, and the deadline to be reached. Depending on the governor it might also be
required that the proposal was queued and that some delay passed.

NOTE: Some modules can modify the requirements for execution, for example by adding an
additional timelock (See `timelock_controller`).

Returns the id of the proposal.

Requirements:

- The proposal must be in the `Succeeded` or `Queued` state.

Emits a {ProposalExecuted} event.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-cancel]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++cancel++#++(calls: Span<Call>, description_hash: felt252) → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Cancels a proposal. A proposal is cancellable by the proposer, but only while it is
Pending state, i.e. before the vote starts.

Returns the id of the proposal.

Requirements:

- The proposal must be in the `Pending` state.
- The caller must be the proposer of the proposal.

Emits a {ProposalCanceled} event.

Cast a vote with a `reason` and additional serialized `params`.

Requirements:

- The proposal must be active.

Emits either:

- {VoteCast} event if no params are provided.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-cast_vote_by_sig]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++cast_vote_by_sig++#++(proposal_id: felt252, support: u8, voter: ContractAddress, signature: Span<felt252>) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Cast a vote using the ``voter``'s signature.

Requirements:

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-nonces]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++nonces++#++(voter: ContractAddress) → felt252++` [.item-kind]#external#

Returns the next unused nonce for an address.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-relay]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++relay++#++(call: Call)++` [.item-kind]#external#

Relays a transaction or function call to an arbitrary target.

In cases where the governance executor is some contract other than the governor itself, like
when using a timelock, this function can be invoked in a governance proposal to recover
tokens that were sent to the governor contract by mistake.

NOTE: If the executor is simply the governor itself, use of `relay` is redundant.

==== Internal functions

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-initializer]]

==== `[.contract-item-name]#++is_valid_description_for_proposer++#++(self: @ContractState, proposer: ContractAddress, description: ByteArray) → bool++` [.item-kind]#internal#

Checks if the proposer is authorized to submit a proposal with the given description.

If the proposal description ends with `#proposer=0x???`, where `0x???` is an address
written as a hex string (case insensitive), then the submission of this proposal will
only be authorized to said address.

This is used for frontrunning protection. By adding this pattern at the end of their
proposal, one can ensure that no other address can submit the same proposal. An attacker
would have to either remove or change that part, which would result in a different
proposal id.

NOTE: In Starknet, the Sequencer ensures the order of transactions, but frontrunning
can still be achieved by nodes, and potentially other actors in the future with
sequencer decentralization.

If the description does not match this pattern, it is unrestricted and anyone can submit
it. This includes:

- If the `0x???` part is not a valid hex string.
- If the `0x???` part is a valid hex string, but does not contain exactly 64 hex digits.
- If it ends with the expected suffix followed by newlines or other whitespace.
- If it ends with some other similar suffix, e.g. `#other=abc`.
- If it does not end with any such suffix.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-_hash_proposal]]

is performed at the end of this block. Hence, voting for this proposal starts at the
beginning of the following block.

[.contract-item]
[[GovernorComponent-_proposal_deadline]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++_proposal_deadline++#++(self: @ContractState, proposal_id: felt252) → u64++` [.item-kind]#internal#

Timepoint at which votes close. If using block number, votes close at the end of this
block, so it is possible to cast a vote during this block.

[[GovernorComponent-assert_only_governance]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++assert_only_governance++#++(self: @ContractState)++` [.item-kind]#internal#

Asserts that the caller is the governance executor.

WARNING: When the executor is not the governor itself (i.e. a timelock), it can call
functions that are restricted with this modifier, and also potentially execute
transactions on behalf of the governor. Because of this, this module is designed to work
with the TimelockController as the unique potential external executor. The timelock
MUST have the governor as the only proposer, canceller, and executor.

== Governor extensions

:extension-traits: xref:#GovernorComponent-Extensions-Traits-Traits[extensions traits]

The Governor component can (and must) be extended by implementing the {extension-traits} to add the desired functionality.
This can be achieved by directly implementing the traits on your contract, or by using a set of ready-to-use extensions
provided by the library, which are presented below.

[.hljs-theme-dark]
```cairo
use openzeppelin_governance::governor::extensions::GovernorTimelockExecutionComponent;
```

Extension of {GovernorComponent} that binds the execution process to an instance of a contract
implementing {TimelockControllerComponent}. This adds a delay, enforced by the timelock
to all successful proposals (in addition to the voting duration).

NOTE: The Governor needs the {roles}[PROPOSER, EXECUTOR, and CANCELLER roles] to work properly.

Using this model means the proposal will be operated by the timelock and not by the
governor. Thus, the assets and permissions must be attached to the timelock. Any asset
sent to the governor will be inaccessible from a proposal, unless executed via
`Governor::relay`.

WARNING: Setting up the timelock to have additional proposers or cancellers besides
the governor is very risky, as it grants them the ability to: 1) execute operations as the
timelock, and thus possibly performing operations or accessing funds that are expected to only
be accessible through a vote, and 2) block governance proposals that have been approved by the
voters, effectively executing a Denial of Service attack.

==== `[.contract-item-name]#++execute_batch++#++(ref self: ContractState, calls: Span<Call>, predecessor: felt252, salt: felt252)++` [.item-kind]#external#

Execute a (Ready) operation containing a batch of Calls.

Requirements:

- Caller must have `EXECUTOR_ROLE`.
- `id` must be in Ready OperationState.
- `predecessor` must either be `0` or in Done OperationState.

Emits a {TimelockComponent-CallExecuted} event for each Call.

NOTE: This function can reenter, but it doesn't pose a risk because `_after_call`
checks that the proposal is pending, thus any modifications to the operation during
reentrancy should be caught.

[.contract-item]
[[TimelockControllerComponent-update_delay]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++update_delay++#++(ref self: ContractState, new_delay: u64)++` [.item-kind]#external#

Changes the minimum timelock duration for future operations.

Requirements:

- The caller must be the timelock itself. This can only be achieved by scheduling
and later executing an operation where the timelock is the target and the data
is the serialized call to this function.

Emits a {TimelockComponent-MinDelayChanged} event.

==== `[.contract-item-name]#++initializer++#++(ref self: ContractState, min_delay: u64, proposers: Span<ContractAddress>, executors: Span<ContractState>, admin: ContractAddress)++` [.item-kind]#internal#

Initializes the contract by registering support for SRC5 and AccessControl.

This function also configures the contract with the following parameters:

- `min_delay`: initial minimum delay in seconds for operations.
- `proposers`: accounts to be granted proposer and canceller roles.
- `executors`: accounts to be granted executor role.
- `admin`: optional account to be granted admin role; disable with zero address.

WARNING: The optional admin can aid with initial configuration of roles after deployment
without being subject to delay, but this role should be subsequently renounced in favor of
administration through timelocked proposals.

Emits two {IAccessControl-RoleGranted} events for each account in `proposers` with `PROPOSER_ROLE` and
`CANCELLER_ROLE` roles.

Emits a {IAccessControl-RoleGranted} event for each account in `executors` with `EXECUTOR_ROLE` role.

May emit a {IAccessControl-RoleGranted} event for `admin` with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` role (if `admin` is
not zero).

Emits {TimelockComponent-MinDelayChanged} event.

[[VotesComponent]]

[.hljs-theme-dark]
```cairo
use openzeppelin_governance::votes::VotesComponent;
```
Component that implements the {IVotes} interface and provides a flexible system for tracking and delegating voting power.

By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper. The downside is that it requires users to delegate to themselves in order to activate checkpoints and have their voting power tracked.

NOTE: When using this module, your contract must implement the {VotingUnitsTrait}. For convenience, this is done automatically for `ERC20` and `ERC721` tokens.

==== `[.contract-item-name]#++get_voting_units++#++(self: @ContractState, account: ContractAddress) → u256++` [.item-kind]#internal#

Returns the number of voting units for a given account.

This implementation is specific to ERC20 tokens, where the balance
of tokens directly represents the number of voting units.

NOTE: This implementation will work out of the box if the ERC20 component
is implemented in the final contract.

WARNING: This implementation assumes tokens map to voting units 1:1.
Any deviation from this formula when transferring voting units (e.g. by using hooks)
may compromise the internal vote accounting.

Returns the number of voting units for a given account.

This implementation is specific to ERC721 tokens, where each token
represents one voting unit. The function returns the balance of
ERC721 tokens for the specified account.

NOTE: This implementation will work out of the box if the ERC721 component
is implemented in the final contract.

Transfers, mints, or burns voting units.

To register a mint, `from` should be zero. To register a burn, `to`
should be zero. Total supply of voting units will be adjusted with mints and burns.

WARNING: If voting units are based on an underlying transferable asset (like a token), you must call this function every time the asset is transferred to keep the internal voting power accounting in sync. For ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, this is typically handled using hooks.

May emit one or two {VotesComponent-DelegateVotesChanged} events.

[[VotingUnitsTrait-get_voting_units]]
==== `[.contract-item-name]#++get_voting_units++#++(self: @TState, account: ContractAddress) → u256++` [.item-kind]#external#

Returns the number of voting units for a given account. For ERC20, this is typically the token balance. For ERC721, this is typically the number of tokens owned.

WARNING: While any formula can be used as a measure of voting units, the internal vote accounting of the contract may be
compromised if voting units are transferred in any external flow by following a different formula. +
For example, when implementing the hook for ERC20, the number of voting units transferred should match the formula given by the
`get_voting_units` implementation.
