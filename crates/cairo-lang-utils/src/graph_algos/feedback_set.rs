//! A feedback-vertex-set is a set of vertices whose removal leaves a graph without cycles
//! (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_vertex_set>).
//! We use this algorithm to spot the relevant places for adding `withdraw_gas` statements in the
//! resulting Sierra code - there should be a `withdraw_gas` call in every recursive call, or in
//! other words, in any cycle in the function call graph.
//! An efficient algorithm to find the minimum feedback-vertex-set in a directed graph is not known,
//! so here we implement some straight-forward algorithm that guarantees to cover all the cycles in
//! the graph, but doesn't necessarily produce the minimum size of such a set.
