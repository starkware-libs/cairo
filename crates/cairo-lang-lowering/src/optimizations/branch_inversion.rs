/// Performs branch inversion optimization on a lowered function.
///
/// The branch inversion optimization finds a match enum whose input is the output of a call to
/// `bool_not_impl`.
/// It swaps the arms of the match enum and changes its input to be the input before the negation.
///
/// This optimization is valid only if all paths leading to the match enum pass through the call to
/// `bool_not_impl`. Therefore, the call to `bool_not_impl` should be in the same block as the match
/// enum.
///
/// The call to `bool_not_impl` is not deleted as we don't know if its output
/// is used by other statements (or block ending).
///
/// Due to the limitations above, the `reorder_statements` function should be called before this
/// optimization and between this optimization and the match optimization.
///
/// The first call to `reorder_statement`s moves the call to `bool_not_impl` into the block whose
/// match enum we want to optimize.
/// The second call to `reorder_statements` removes the call to `bool_not_impl` if it is unused,
/// allowing the match optimization to be applied to enum_init statements that appeared before the
/// `bool_not_impl`.
