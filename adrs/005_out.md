# 005: Output parameter

# Context

A repeating pattern is a function that gets an instance of a (possibly linear) type, and returns
an instance of that type.
Right now, it is cumbersome in the declaration and usage:
```
func foo(dict: Dict, a: felt) -> (Dict, bool) {
    let (new_dict, res) = foo(dict, 1);
    dict = new_dict
    (dict, res)
}
```

# Proposal
Add then 'out' keyword modifer on parameters and arguments to mean that the passed argument is
assigned to, as well.

The following code is equivalent to the code above:
```
func foo(out dict: Dict, a: felt) -> bool {
    foo(out dict, 1)
}
```
