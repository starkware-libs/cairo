# 005: Mutable parameter

# Context

A repeating pattern is a function that gets an instance of a (possibly linear) type, and returns
an instance of that type.
Right now, it is cumbersome in the declaration and usage:
```
func foo(dict: Dict, a: felt) -> (Dict, bool) {
    let (new_dict, res) = foo(dict, 1);
    dict = new_dict
    (dict, res)
}
```

# Proposal
Add the 'mut' keyword modifier on parameters and arguments to mean that the passed argument is
assigned to, as well.

The following code is equivalent to the code above:
```
func foo(mut dict: Dict, a: felt) -> bool {
    foo(mut dict, 1)
}
```

`mut` parameters must appear before any non `mut` parameter, except `self` if present.
