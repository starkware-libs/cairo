//! Account module defining the [`Call`] struct and the [`AccountContract`] trait.
//!
//! The `Call` struct represents a call to a contract, with the following fields:
//! - `to`: The address of the contract to call.
//! - `selector`: The entry point selector in the called contract.
//! - `calldata`: The calldata to pass to the entry point.
//!
//! The `AccountContract` trait defines the standard interface for account contracts. It assumes
//! that the calldata for invoke transactions is an `Array<Call>`, following the SNIP6 standard.
//!
//! Implementing this trait allows contracts to function as account contracts in the Starknet
//! network, supporting class declarations and batched call execution.
