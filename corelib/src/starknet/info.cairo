//! Information about the Starknet execution environment.
//!
//! This module provides access to runtime information about the current transaction,
//! block, and execution context in a Starknet smart contract. It enables contracts
//! to access execution context data.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use core::starknet::{get_block_info, get_caller_address, get_contract_address};
//!
//! // Get block information
//! let block_info = get_block_info().unbox();
//! let timestamp = block_info.block_timestamp;
//!
//! // Get caller and contract addresses
//! let caller = get_caller_address();
//! let contract = get_contract_address();
//! ```
