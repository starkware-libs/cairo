//! Utilities for interacting with the Starknet OS.
//!
//! Writing smart contracts requires various associated operations, such as calling another contract
//! or accessing the contract’s storage, that standalone programs do not require. Cairo supports
//! these operations by using system calls.
//!
//! System calls enable a contract to require services from the Starknet OS. You can use system
//! calls in a function to get information that depends on the broader state of Starknet, such as
//! the current timestamp of the address of the caller, but also to modify the state of Starknet by,
//! for example, storing values in a contract's storage or deploying new contracts.
