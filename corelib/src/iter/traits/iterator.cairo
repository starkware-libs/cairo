    /// `map()` transforms one iterator into another, by means of its argument:
    /// something that implements [`FnOnce`]. It produces a new iterator which
    /// calls this closure on each element of the original iterator.
    ///
    /// If you are good at thinking in types, you can think of `map()` like this:
    /// If you have an iterator that gives you elements of some type `A`, and
    /// you want an iterator of some other type `B`, you can use `map()`,
    /// passing a closure that takes an `A` and returns a `B`.
    ///
    /// `map()` is conceptually similar to a `for` loop. However, as `map()` is
    /// lazy, it is best used when you're already working with other iterators.
    /// If you're doing some sort of looping for a side effect, it's considered
    /// more idiomatic to use `for` than `map()`.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// Basic usage:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let mut iter = array![1, 2, 3].into_iter().map(|x| 2 * x);
    ///
    /// assert!(iter.next() == Option::Some(2));

    /// If you're doing some sort of side effect, prefer `for` to `map()`:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// // don't do this:
    /// let _ = (0..5_usize).into_iter().map(|x| println!("{x}"));
    ///
    /// // it won't even execute, as it is lazy. Cairo will warn you about this if not specifically
    /// ignored, as is done here.

    ///     println!("{x}");

    /// arguments: an 'accumulator', and an element. The closure returns the value that
    /// the accumulator should have for the next iteration.

    /// call.
    ///
    /// After applying this closure to every element of the iterator, `fold()`

    /// Folding is useful whenever you have a collection of something, and want
    /// to produce a single value from it.
    ///
    /// Note: `fold()`, and similar methods that traverse the entire iterator,
    /// might not terminate for infinite iterators, even on traits for which a
    /// result is determinable in finite time.
    ///
    /// Note: `fold()` combines elements in a *left-associative* fashion. For associative
    /// operators like `+`, the order the elements are combined in is not important, but for
    /// non-associative operators like `-` the order will affect the final result.
    ///
    /// # Note to Implementors
    ///
    /// Several of the other (forward) methods have default implementations in
    /// terms of this one, so try to implement this explicitly if it can
    /// do something better than the default `for` loop implementation.
    ///
    /// In particular, try to have this call `fold()` on the internal parts
    /// from which this iterator is composed.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// Basic usage:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// let mut iter = array![1, 2, 3].into_iter();
    ///
    /// // the sum of all of the elements of the array
    /// let sum = iter.fold(0, |acc, x| acc + x);
    ///
    /// assert_eq!(sum, 6);
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Let's walk through each step of the iteration here:
    ///
    /// | element | acc | x | result |
    /// |---------|-----|---|--------|
    /// |         | 0   |   |        |
    /// | 1       | 0   | 1 | 1      |
    /// | 2       | 1   | 2 | 3      |
    /// | 3       | 3   | 3 | 6      |
    ///
    /// And so, our final result, `6`.
    ///
    /// It's common for people who haven't used iterators a lot to
    /// use a `for` loop with a list of things to build up a result. Those
    /// can be turned into `fold()`s:
