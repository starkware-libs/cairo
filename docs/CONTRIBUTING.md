## Development environment setup

> **[?]**
> Proceed to describe how to setup local development environment.
> e.g:

To set up a development environment, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/starkware-libs-cairo
   ```

2. Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3. Follow instructions in [vscode-cairo](../vscode-cairo/README.md).

The `rustfmt` configuration used by cairo requires a nightly version of Rust. 
You can install the nightly version by running.
```sh
rustup install nightly-2023-07-05
```

If you have a lot of failing tests when running
`cargo test`
and those are due to file diff not being correct, there is a way to automatically fix it.
Run the tests again, with the `CAIRO_FIX_TESTS` environment variable set to `1`:
```sh
CAIRO_FIX_TESTS=1 cargo test
```
Some tests should now be fixed.

## Issues and feature requests

You've found a bug in the source code, a mistake in the documentation or maybe you'd like a new
feature? Take a look at [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/starkware-libs-cairo/discussions)
to see if it's already being discussed. You can help us by
[submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/starkware-libs-cairo/issues).
Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue may have already
been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.

**Even better: Submit a pull request with a fix or new feature!**

### How to submit a Pull Request

1. Search our repository for open or closed
   [Pull Requests](https://github.com/starkware-libs-cairo/pulls)
   that relate to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
2. Fork the project
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feat/amazing_feature`)
4. Implement your feature
5. Run the code formatter for Rust and Cairo (`scripts/rust_fmt.sh && scripts/cairo_fmt.sh`)
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: Add amazing_feature'`)
7. Push to the branch (`git push origin feat/amazing_feature`)
8. [Open a Pull Request](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/compare) to one of the following
branches:
    * [main](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/tree/main) -
    If the change does not break any existing Cairo code (**Cairo backward-compatible**), and does
    not affect Sierra to CASM compilation.
    * [cairo-major-update](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/tree/cairo-major-update) -
    If the change breaks existing high level code (**Cairo non-backward-compatible**), and does not
    affect Sierra to CASM compilation.
    * [sierra-minor-update](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/tree/sierra-minor-update) -
    If Sierra to CASM compilation changed in a **backward-compatible** manner - meaning existing
    Sierra code will compile to the same CASM. For example, addition of a new libfunc.
    * [sierra-major-update](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/tree/sierra-major-update) -
    If Sierra to CASM compilation changed in a **non-backward-compatible** manner - meaning
    existing Sierra code will compile to different CASM. For example, editing the CASM
    implementation of a an existing libfunc. This may also include no longer accepting some old
    Sierra code.
