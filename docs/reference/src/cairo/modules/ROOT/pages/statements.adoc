Cairo is an expression-oriented language, where most syntax productions producing values or
causing effects when evaluated are _expressions_.
Many expressions can nest within each other, and sequence of evaluation is driven by precedence
and associativity rules.

There are not a lot of statements kinds, which role is limited to containing explicitly sequential
link:expression-statement.adoc[expression evaluation] and declaring link:items.adoc[items]
and link:let-statement.adoc[variables] in [code blocks].

== Semicolons

Statements are _usually_ separated with a semicolon (`;`).
Extraneous semicolons are ignored.
Semicolons _after_ last statement in code block _may_ be omitted and have a separate semantic
meaning as it makes the statement define returned value of enclosing code block
(see [code blocks] for more details).
