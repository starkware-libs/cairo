= Box module

The box module provides a wrapper data structure called `Box<T>` for elements of type `T`. Similar to Rust's `Box<T>`, this data structure allows you to store and manage heap-allocated values of any type in a uniform way, making it easier to work with generic types and providing a level of indirection when needed. The module also provides a trait, `BoxTrait<T>`, which defines common operations on a `Box<T>`, such as creating a new Box and unwrapping the value stored in it.

Here is a brief summary of the components in the box module:

[cols="2*",options="header"]
|===
| Module Component | Description
| `Box<T>` | The primary data structure representing a wrapper for elements of type `T`.
| `BoxTrait<T>` | A trait that defines common operations on a `Box<T>` such as creating a new Box and unwrapping the stored value.

We will explore each of these components in more detail and provide examples of how to use them effectively.
