= Introduction to the Cairo core library

The "Cairo Core Library" encompasses a variety of components designed to facilitate the development of Cairo smart contracts and applications.

== Structure

This documentation is organized into the following sections:

* Modules: A collection of modules that offer various functionalities, grouped by their application domains. Each module contains an in-depth exploration of its components, such as structs, functions, and more.
* Native Types: A list of Cairo's primitive types that serve as the building blocks for more complex data structures
* Keywords: Core keywords in the Cairo language that define its syntax and structure.
* Macros: Predefined macros that provide convenient shortcuts and enable code generation during compilation.

By following this structure, we will first provide a quick overview of Cairo's native types, macros, keywords, and modules on this page. Then, we will create directories for each module and delve deeper into their components, such as structs, functions, and more.

* TODO

If this is your first time, the documentation for the standard library is written to be casually perused. Clicking on interesting things should generally lead you to interesting places. Still, there are important bits you don't want to miss, so read on for a tour of the standard library and its documentation!

Notice the source link. Cairo's documentation comes with the source code, and you are encouraged to read it. The standard library source is generally high quality, and a peek behind the curtains is often enlightening.

Let the show begin!

== Macros

A list of macros in Cairo, along with a brief description of each macro's purpose and functionality:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Macro | Description
| assert | A macro that checks if a given condition is true, and if not, raises an error. Used for enforcing invariants and validating input.
| fn | A macro that defines a function, specifying its name, input parameters, and return type. Used for creating reusable code blocks.
| panic | A macro that immediately aborts the execution of the current function and unwinds the call stack. Used for error handling and control flow when an unrecoverable error occurs.

In the following sections, we will explore each of these modules in depth, providing you with detailed information on their purpose, functionality, and usage examples.

== Keywords

A list of keywords in Cairo, along with a brief description of each keyword's purpose and functionality:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Keyword | Description
| await | Used to suspend the execution of a function until a future or asynchronous operation is completed.
| const | Indicates that the declared value is a constant and cannot be changed after initialization.
| let | Used to declare and bind a value to a variable name.
| if | A conditional branching keyword used to execute a code block only if a given condition is true.
| fn | Used to define a function, specifying its name, input parameters, and return type.
| false | A boolean literal representing the "false" value.
| enum | Defines an enumeration, a distinct type that consists of a set of named values.
| extern | Indicates that the following block contains external functions or items that are implemented elsewhere.
| else | A conditional branching keyword used in conjunction with `if` to provide an alternative code block to execute when the `if` condition is false.
| impl | Used to implement a trait for a specific type, providing the actual code for the trait's methods.
| loop | Creates an infinite loop, which can be terminated using a control flow keyword like `break` or `return`.
| match | A keyword for pattern matching, allowing the execution of a specific code block based on the value of an expression.
| mod | Declares a module, which is a collection of related functions, types, and items.
| mut | Indicates that a variable is mutable and its value can be changed after initialization.
| pub | Specifies that a function, type, or item is public and can be accessed from outside its module.
| ref | Used to create a reference to a value or variable, allowing it to be shared without copying or transferring ownership.
| return | A keyword used to return a value from a function.
| self | Refers to the current instance of an object or the current module when used in a function or method.
| struct | Defines a structured data type, which is a composite type that contains named fields.
| super | Refers to the parent module or namespace when used in a path.
| trait | Defines a trait, which is a collection of methods and associated types that can be implemented by different types.
| true | A boolean literal representing the "true" value.
| type | Used to create a type alias, which is a new name for an existing type.
| use | Imports a function, type, or item from another module, making it available for use in the current scope.
