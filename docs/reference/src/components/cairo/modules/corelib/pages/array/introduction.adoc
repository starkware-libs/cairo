= Array module

The array module provides a dynamic array data structure called Array<T> for elements of type T. This data structure allows you to create and manipulate arrays in a dynamic and efficient way. The module also provides a trait, ArrayTrait<T>, which defines common operations on an Array<T>.

Here is a brief summary of the components in the array module:

|===
| Module Component | Description
| Array<T> | The primary data structure representing a dynamic array of elements of type T.
| ArrayTrait<T> | A trait that defines common operations on an Array<T> such as creating a new array, appending elements, popping elements from the front, and retrieving elements by index.
| Span<T> | A utility structure that provides a view over an Array<T> for efficient iteration and manipulation.
| SpanTrait<T> | A trait that defines common operations on a Span<T> such as popping elements from the front or back, and retrieving elements by index.

In the following sections, we will explore each of these components in more detail and provide examples of how to use them effectively.
