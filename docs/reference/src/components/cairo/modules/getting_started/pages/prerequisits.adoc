# Prerequisites

- Install link:https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install[Rust]
- Setup Rust:
```bash
rustup override set stable && rustup update
```

Ensure Rust was installed correctly by running the following from the root project directory:
```bash
cargo test
```

## Development environment setup

To set up a development environment, please follow these steps:

1 . Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/starkware-libs-cairo
```

2 . Download and install link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[VSCode].

3 . Follow instructions in link:https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/blob/main/vscode-cairo/README.md[vscode-cairo].

The `rustfmt` configuration used by cairo requires a nightly version of Rust.
You can install the nightly version by running.

```sh
rustup install nightly-2022-11-03
```

[NOTE]
====
If you have a lot of failing tests when running
`cargo test`
and those are due to file diff not being correct, there is a way to automatically fix it.
Run the tests again, with the `CAIRO_FIX_TESTS` environment variable set to `1`:
```sh
CAIRO_FIX_TESTS=1 cargo test
```
Some tests should now be fixed.
