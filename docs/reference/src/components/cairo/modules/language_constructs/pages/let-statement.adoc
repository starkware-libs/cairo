= Let statement

// TODO(spapini): Explain about mut and patterns.
A _let statement_ introduces a new set of variables, given by an irrefutable pattern.
The pattern is followed optionally by a type annotation and then by an initializer expression.
Variables are _always_ initialized to some value.

When no type annotation is given, the compiler infers the type, or signals an error if
insufficient type information is available for definite inference.

// TODO(spapini): Add an explanation about shadowing.
Any variable introduced by a this declaration is visible from the point of declaration
until the end of the enclosing block scope, except when it is shadowed by another variable
declaration.
