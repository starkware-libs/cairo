= Type aliases

A "type alias" defines a new name for an existing type. Type aliases are declared with the keyword type. Every value has a single, specific type, but may implement several different traits, or be compatible with several different type constraints.

For example, the following defines the type "Num" as a synonym for the type u8, the type of unsigned 8 bit integers:



 type Num = u8;
fn main() -> (bool) {
   let firstnum: Num = 7_u8;
   let secondnum: u8 = 7_u8;  
   if firstnum == secondnum {
      return true;
   } else {
      return false;
   }
}
