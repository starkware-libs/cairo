= Prelude

A _prelude_ is a collection of items that are always available in every module in a program.

The _standard library prelude_ is a module defined in the core library based on your crate's edition
(e.g., `core::prelude::v2024_07`).
It is automatically used in every module.
It is not possible to disable standard library prelude importing.
This means that items from the prelude are always in scope without explicit imports,
which is why you can use types like `Option`, `Result`, and common traits without importing them.
