= Derive macro

The _derive macro_ is added to a type definition to provide it with some basic implementations.
The derive macro is used to implement traits for structs and enums automatically.
The compiler will generate implementations for the requested traits.
Note this is supported for generic types as well.

== Existing derived traits
* `Copy` - Marks the type as being safe to copy by simply copying bits.
All members of the type must also be `Copy`.
See xref:linear-types.adoc[linear types] for more information.
* `Clone` - Implements the clone method to explicitly create a copy of the type.
All members of the type must also be `Clone`.
See xref:linear-types.adoc[linear types] for more information.
* `Drop` - Marks the type as being safe to drop.
All members of the type must also be `Drop`.
See xref:linear-types.adoc[linear types] for more information.
* `Destruct` - Implements the destruct method to explicitly destroy the type.
All members of the type must also be `Destruct`.
See xref:linear-types.adoc[linear types] for more information.
* `PartialEq` - Implements the xref::equality-operators.adoc[equality operators] `==` and `!=` for the type.
All members of the type must also be `PartialEq`.
* `Serde` - Implements the Serde trait for serialization and deserialization for the type.
All members of the type must also be `Serde`.
