= Type and impl aliases

A type alias is a new name for an existing type. It is not a new type. This means that the alias and
the original type are treated as the same type by the compiler and can be used interchangeably.
Type aliases are created with the type keyword:
[source,cairo]
----
type NewName<Generics> = ConcreteType;
----

Examples:
[source,cairo]
----
type IntAlias = i32;
type BoxIntAlias = Box<i32>;
type BoxOption<T> = Box<Option<T>>;
----

For information about impl aliases, see xref:impl-aliases.adoc[Impl aliases].
