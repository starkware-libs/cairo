= Naming conventions

This chapter covers standard naming conventions.

== Casing

In general, use `PascalCase` for names of types or traits and use `snake_case` otherwise.
More precisely:

[cols="1,2",options="header"]
|===
| Item            | Convention
| Modules         | `snake_case`
| Types           | `PascalCase`
| Traits          | `PascalCase`
| Enum variants   | `PascalCase`
| Struct fields   | `snake_case`
| Functions       | `snake_case`
| Methods         | `snake_case`
| Variables       | `snake_case`
| Constants       | `UPPER_CASE`
| Type parameters | `PascalCase` generally, a single letter like `T` usually
|===

In `PascalCase`, acronyms count as one word: use `Sha` rather than `SHA`.
In `snake_case`, acronyms are lower-cased: `sha3_hash`.

In `snake_case` or `UPPER_CASE`, a _word_ should never consist of a single character unless it is
a digit or the last _word_.
So, we have `btree_map` rather than `b_tree_map`, but `PI_2` rather than `PI2`.
// TODO: More suitable examples

Language implementations can emit warnings when names do not follow these rules.

== Underscore prefix (e.g. `_foo`)

The name of an unused variable must start with an _ (a common example is simply "_").

[source,rust]
----
let _unused = compute_something();
----

Language implementations can emit warnings when a variable **not** starting with an underscore is
only written-to but is never read. The same applies when a variable starting with an underscore is
read.
