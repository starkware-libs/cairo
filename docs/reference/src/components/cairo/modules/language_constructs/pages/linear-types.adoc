= Linear types

// TODO(spapini): Move to language semantics.
Linear types are a way to statically ensure that a value is used exactly once. Cairo supports linear
types by having `move semantics` and forbidding copying and dropping values by default.

== Move semantics
When passing a value to a function, it is moved by default. This means that after a value is used
for the first time, it cannot be used again. For example, the following code does not compile:

```rust
struct A {}

fn main() {
    let a = A {};
    foo(a); // value is passed by value once here.
    foo(a); // error: Value was previously moved.
}
```

To allow a value to be used multiple times, the `Copy` trait must be implemented for it.
For example, the following code compiles:

```rust
#[derive(Copy)]
struct A {}

fn main() {
    let a = A {};
    foo(a); // value is passed by value once here.
    foo(a); // Now there is no error.
}
```

Note: the snapshot operator `@` (See the docs about snapshot) is not considered moving a value.

== Clone
Sometime a value cannot not be trivially copied, but we can still use code to build a of copy it.
For example, a value containing an `Array` cannot be copied, but we can still clone it by cloning
the array it contains with `.clone()`.
This can be done by implementing or deriving the `Clone` trait. The derived implementation requires
that all fields implement `Clone`, and will automatically call `.clone()` on all the fields.

== Variable dropping
By default, a value may not go out of scope unless it was previously moved. For example, the
following code does not compile:

```rust
#[derive(Copy)]
struct A {}

fn main() {
    A {}; // error: Value not dropped.
}
```

To allow a value to be dropped, the `Drop` trait must be implemented for it.
For example, the following code compiles:

```rust
#[derive(Drop)]
struct A {}

fn main() {
    A {}; // Now there is no error.
}
```

== Destructors
Sometime a value must not be dropped, but we can still use code to get rid of it.
For example, a value containing a `Dict` cannot be dropped, but we can still deconstruct it by
destructing the dict it contains with `.destruct()`.
This can be done by implementing or deriving the `Destruct` trait, which will be called
automatically when a non-droppable value goes out of scope. The derived implementation requires
that all fields implement `Destruct`, and will automatically call `.destruct()` on all the fields.

```rust
#[derive(Destruct)]
struct A {
    d: Dict<usize>
}

fn main() {
    A {}; // No error, A will be destructed.
}
```

When implementing `Destruct` manually, note that the implementation must be `nopanic`, because
destructors are called when a value goes out of scope, which may happen in a panic.

== Copy and drop restrictions
`Copy` cannot be implemented for a type that contains a non-copyable field.
Similarly, `Drop` cannot be implemented for a type that contains a non-droppable field.
Some basic data types of Cairo are inherently non-copyable and non-droppable.
`Array` is not copyable, while `Dict` is not copyable nor droppable.
The reason for this has to do with Cairo's immutable memory model.

== Snapshot
The snapshot type is always copyable and droppable. It is used to create an immutable snapshot of a
value.

== Common pitfalls and solutions
* How to avoid "Value was previously moved" errors?
** Use `@` to create a snapshot of the value.
** Use `ref` to pass the value by reference.
** Implement or derive `Copy` to allow the value to be copied.
** Implement or derive `Clone` to allow the value to be cloned.
** For a generic parameter, add another generic parameter for Copy or Clone (e.g. `impl TCopy: Copy<T>`).
* How to avoid "Value was not dropped" errors?
** Implement or derive `Drop` to allow the value to be dropped.
** Implement or derive `Destruct` to allow the value to be destructed.
** For structs, deconstruct them using `let A { .. } = a;`.
** For enums, deconstruct them using `match`.
** In particular, for the 'never' type, match like this: `match x {}`.
** For a generic parameter, add another generic parameter for Drop or Destruct (e.g. `impl TDrop: Drop<T>`).
** Find a function that can be used to destroy the value, and call it.
