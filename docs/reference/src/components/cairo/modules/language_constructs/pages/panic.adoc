= Panic

Code in _Cairo1.0_ may _panic_ - which means it may fail with an unrecoverable error - meaning
it is impossible to catch and handle.
When the program panics, using the xref:linear-types.adoc[linear type system] all living variables
on the stack would be `Dropped` or otherwise destructed, which makes sure the run remains provable
and valid.

== `panic` function

The basic function that all panic stems from is the `panic` function.
It is defined as:
[source,rust]
----
extern fn panic(data: Array<felt252>) -> never;
----

The `panic` function takes a single argument, which is a `felt252` array.
This array is the data that is passed as the reason the run panicked.
The `panic` function never returns, and is marked as such with the
xref:never-type.adoc[never type].

== `nopanic` notation

Functions may be marked with the `nopanic` notation.
This means that the function will never panic.
This can be useful for writing code that may never fail.
Only _nopanic_ functions may be called from a _nopanic_ function.

=== `nopanic` and traits

If a trait function is marked with `nopanic`, all implementations of that trait must also be marked
with `nopanic`, as the trait function may be called from a _nopanic_ function.
An example for such a function is `Destruct` trait `destruct` function, which is _nopanic_ as it is
called during panic handling, see xref:linear-types.adoc[linear type system] for more info.

If a trait function is not marked with `nopanic`, all implementations of that trait may be marked
with `nopanic` or not.
An example for such a function is `Add` trait `add` function, which is _nopanic_ for `felt252` addition, but isn't so for integer addition.

== `panic_with` macro

A function returning an `Option` or `Result` may be marked with the `panic_with` macro.
This macro takes two arguments: the data that is passed as the panic reason as well as the
name for a wrapping function.
If the function returns `None` or `Err`, _panic_ function will be called with the given data.

[source,rust]
----
#[panic_with('got none value', unwrap)]
fn identity(value: Option<u128>) -> Option<u128> { value }
----

Some `fn unwrap(value: Option<u128>) -> u128` that internally may panic may be created.
