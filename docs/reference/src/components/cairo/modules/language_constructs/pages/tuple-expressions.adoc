= Tuple expressions

A tuple expression constructs xref:tuple-types.adoc[tuple] values.
The syntax for tuple expressions is a parenthesized, comma separated list of expressions.
1-ary tuple expressions require a comma after their tuple initializer operand to be disambiguated with a parenthetical expression.

Tuple expressions without any tuple initializer operands produce the unit tuple value.

Examples:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Expression                    | Type
| ()                            | ()
| (1_u32,)                      | (u32,)
| (1_u32, Some(3_u8))           | (u32, Option<u8>)
| (True, False, 'abc')          | (bool, bool, felt252)
|===
