= Tuple expressions

A tuple expression constructs xref:tuple-types.adoc[tuple] values.

== Syntax

The syntax for tuple expressions is a parenthesized, comma separated list of expressions:

[source,cairo]
----
(expression1, expression2, ..., expressionN)
----

=== 0-ary tuples (unit type)

Tuple expressions without any tuple initializer operands produce the unit tuple value `()`.

=== 1-ary tuples

1-ary tuple expressions require a trailing comma after their tuple initializer operand to be disambiguated with a parenthetical expression.

- `(1,)` is a 1-ary tuple of type `(felt252,)`
- `(1)` is just a parenthetical expression evaluating to `1`, not a tuple

This trailing comma is mandatory for single-element tuples to distinguish them from ordinary parenthesized expressions.

=== N-ary tuples (N ≥ 2)

Tuples with two or more elements use comma-separated expressions without requiring a trailing comma:

[source,cairo]
----
(1, 2)           // 2-ary tuple
(1, 2, 3)        // 3-ary tuple
(true, 5_u32)    // Mixed-type tuple
----

== Semantics

A tuple expression is evaluated by evaluating each of its operand expressions from left to right, then constructing a tuple value with the results in the same order.

== Examples

Valid examples:

[cols="1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Expression                    | Type
| ()                            | ()
| (1_u32,)                      | (u32,)
| (1_u32, Some(3_u8))           | (u32, Option<u8>)
| (true, false, 'abc')          | (bool, bool, felt252)
| ((1, 2), (3, 4))              | ((felt252, felt252), (felt252, felt252))
|===

Invalid examples (illustrative):

- Missing comma in 1-ary tuple: `(1)` when intending a tuple (this is just a parenthesized expression)
- Trailing comma in 0-ary tuple: `(,)` is invalid syntax
- Missing parentheses: `1, 2` is not a tuple expression (tuples require parentheses)
