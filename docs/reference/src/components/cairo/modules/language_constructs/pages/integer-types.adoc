= Integer types

Cairo uses the following integer types:


[options="header"]
|===
| Type  | Minimum | Maximum
| u8    | 0       | 2^8 - 1
| u16   | 0       | 2^16 - 1
| u32   | 0       | 2^32 - 1
| u64   | 0       | 2^64 - 1
| u128  | 0       | 2^128 - 1
| u256  | 0       | 2^256 - 1
|===

The `usize` type is an alias to `u32`, and is used for array indexing.

== Integer Creation

All integer types except `u256` can be created as literals using the appropriate suffix. The `u256` type is only supported by construction from other types.

----
fn main() {
    let x: u8 = 10_u8;
    let y = 0xff_u64;
    // let z = 10_u256; // Error: u256 literals are not supported
    let z: u256 = u256 { high: 0_u128, low: 10_u128 } // 10 in u256 type
}

== Integer Operations
Currently, all integer types but `u256` support the operations in the following table.

[options="header"]
|===
| Operation | Description           | Supported by `u256`
| `+`       | Addition              | Yes
| `-`       | Subtraction           | Yes
| `*`       | Multiplication        | Yes
| `/`       | Integer division      | Yes
| `%`       | Modulo                | No
| `==`      | Equality              | Yes
| `!=`      | Inequality            | Yes
| `<`       | Less than             | Yes
| `\<=`     | Less than or equal    | Yes
| `>`       | Greater than          | Yes
| `>=`      | Greater than or equal | Yes
| `\|`      | Bitwise or            | Yes
| `&`       | Bitwise and           | Yes
| `^`       | Bitwise xor           | Yes
