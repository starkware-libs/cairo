= Expression statement

An _expression statement_ evaluates an xref:expressions.adoc[expression] and ignores its result.
Its purpose is to trigger side effects of expression evaluation only.

When an expression that ends with a block (i.e. '}') is used in a context where a statement is
permitted, the trailing semicolon can be omitted without changing the semantic meaning.
This is different than omitting the semicolon after a non-block expression.
// TODO(spapini) Add links to the relevant expressions when they are written.
This can include if, match, for, etc.
This can cause an ambiguity between it being parsed as a standalone statement and as a part of
another expression; in this case, it is parsed as a statement.

// TODO(spapini): Use cairo syntax highlighting.

v.pop();          // Ignore the element returned from pop
if v.is_empty() {
    v.push(5);
} else {
    v.remove(0);
}                 // Semicolon can be omitted.
[1];              // Separate expression statement, not an indexing expression
----

When the trailing semicolon is omitted, the result return type of the expression must be
the xref:unit-type.adoc[unit type].

// bad: the block's type is i32, not ()

  1
