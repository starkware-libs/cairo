= Variables

A variable is a named entity that holds a value.
It provides a way to store data and refer to it later in the program by a name.
By using variables, you can manipulate the data in different ways, perform computations,
and create more complex programs.

There are several ways to introduce variables in a Cairo program.

== Let statement

Variables can be defined using the link:let-statement.adoc[`let`] keyword with the following syntax:
[source]
----
let x: u32 = 5_u32;
----
declares a variable named `x` of type `u32` with an initial value of `5`.

The type annotation can be omitted in cases where the type can be deduced.

For example:
[source]
----
let x = 5_u32;
----

Variables are immutable unless declared otherwise.
A variable can be declared as mutable using the `mut` keyword.
A mutable variable can be link:assignment-statement.adoc[assigned] a different value after the initialization.

For example:
[source]
----
let mut x = 17;
x = x + 3;
----

== Function parameters

Every function parameter introduces a variable that is accessible in the body of a function.

For example:
[source]
----
fn add(x: u32, mut y: u32) -> u32 {
   y += x;
   y
}

fn test() {
    let x = 1;
    ley y = 2;
    assert(add(x, y) == 3, 'Should be equal.');
    assert(y == 1, 'Should be equal.');
}
----

A function parameter can have the `mut` modifier and it has the same meaning as in let statements,
that is, we can change it inside the body of the function, but the change is not reflected
in the caller.

A function parameter may also have the `ref` modifier which means that the variable is an input and
an output. In this case, the caller must pass a mutable variable and use the `ref` keyword.
Changing the variable in the called function also changes it in the caller.
Note that `ref` parameters are mutable. Using both modifiers on the same parameter is not
allowed.

For example:
[source]
----
fn inc_by_one(ref x: u32) {
   x = x + 1;
}

fn test() {
    let mut y = 2;
    inc_by_one(ref y);
    assert(y == 3, 'Should be equal.');
}
----

== Patterns in match arms

A variable can be introduced inside a match arm.

for example:
[source]
----
match opt {
    Option::Some(x) => x,
    Option::None => 0,
}
----



== Shadowing

A variable name can be reused in an inner scope (or the same scope).
In this case, the variable shadows the variable in the outer scope,
but it does not change the variable in the outer scope.

for example:
[source]
----
let x = 5;
{
    let x = 8;
}
assert(x == 5, 'Should be equal.');
----

In contrast when a mutable variable is assigned in an inner scope, it also changes in the outer
scope.

[source]
----
let mut x = 5;
{
    x = 8;
}
assert(x == 8, 'Should be equal.');
----
