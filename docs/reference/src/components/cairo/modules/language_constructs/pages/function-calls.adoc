= Function calls

A call expression calls a xref:functions.adoc[function]. The syntax for a call expression is the
xref:path.adoc[concrete path] of the function followed by a list of arguments.
The list of arguments is a comma-separated list of expressions enclosed in parentheses.
[source,rust]
----
<concrete_path>(<arg0>,<arg1>,...)
----

Examples:

[source,rust]
----
cmp::max(a: 5, b: 1)
get_info()
increment(ref a.b)
----

A call expression evaluates to the value returned by the function.
The expression's type is the return type of the function.
For example, the expression `is_le(1, 3)` evaluates to `true`, and its type is `bool`.

== Arguments

The number of arguments passed should match the number of parameters defined in the function
signature. The type of each argument should match the type of the corresponding parameter.
There are 2 kinds of arguments: Expressions and references.
A reference argument is passed to reference parameters, and an expression argument is passed to
regular parameters.

=== Expression arguments

Any expression can be passed to a regular parameter. The type of the expression should match the
type of the parameter. Example: `cmp::max(a: 5, b: 1)`.

=== Reference arguments

The syntax for a reference argument is xref:lvalue.adoc[`ref lvalue`]. The type of `lvalue` should
match the type of the reference parameter.
The behavior of passing a reference argument is similar to the
xref:assignment-statement.adoc[assignment].
`lvalue` is passed to the function and then reassigned to when the function returns.
Example: `increment(ref a.b)`.

[source,rust]
----
fn main() {
    let x = 3;
    let mut y = A { z: 5 };
    foo(x, ref y.z);
}
----

== Argument evaluation order

The arguments are evaluated from left to right, starting with all the expression arguments, and
then the reference arguments. This is important, since the value of a reference argument may change
during evaluation of the expression arguments.

== Named arguments

Arguments can also be specified explicitly by the parameter name.
For example `inc_3(x: 7)`.
This is called a "named argument" and it verifies that the name of the parameter is correct,
to prevent mistakes.
For example, a call to `inc_3(y: 7)` would not compile
- If you use a variable as an argument and its name is the same as the parameter name, a
shorthand for writing `inc_3(x: x)` is to simply write `inc_3(:x)`.
This lets you write the name only once, but still verifies it.
Here too, `inc_3(:y)` (assuming there is a variable `y` in the scope) would not compile.
With a reference argument, you can write `mut_inc_3(ref x:y)`, or `mut_inc_3(ref :x)`.
