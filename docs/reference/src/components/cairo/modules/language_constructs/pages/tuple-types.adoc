= Tuple types

A tuple type is a parenthesized, comma-separated list of types.

The tuple type with no fields `()` is also called the xref:unit-type.adoc[Unit type]

Examples:
[source, cairo]
---
() // Unit type.
(u32, u256)
(felt252, u16, Option<u8>)
---

Values of this type are constructed using a xref:tuple-expressions.adoc[tuple expressions].
Tuples can be deconstructed using xref:patterns.adoc[patterns].
