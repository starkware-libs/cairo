= Tuple types

A tuple type is a parenthesized, comma-separated list of types.
1-ary tuples require a comma after their element type to be disambiguated with a parenthesized type.

A tuple type has a number of fields equal to the length of the list of types. This number of fields determines the arity of the tuple. A tuple with n fields is called an n-ary tuple. For example, a tuple with 2 fields is a 2-ary tuple.

The tuple type with no fields `()` is also called the xref:unit-type.adoc[Unit type]

Examples:
[source, cairo]
---
() // Unit type.
(bool,)
(u32, u256)
(felt252, u16, Option<u8>)
---

Values of this type are constructed using a xref:tuple-expressions.adoc[tuple expressions].
Tuples can be deconstructed using xref:patterns.adoc[patterns].
