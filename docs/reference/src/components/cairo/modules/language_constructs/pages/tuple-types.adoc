= Tuple types

_tuple type_ is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type.

We can create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside `()`. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different values in the tuple donâ€™t have to be the same. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

fn main() -> u64 {
    // A tuple of Boolean, u64, u128
    let tup01 = (true, 666_u64, 999_u128);
    let (var_1, var_2, var_3) = tup01;
    var_2 // return `666`
}
