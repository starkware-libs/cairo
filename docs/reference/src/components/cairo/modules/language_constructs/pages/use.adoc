= Use

The `use` item in the Cairo programming language is used to make an item from another module
directly accessible in the current module.

```rust
mod foo {
    fn bar() {
        // ...
    }
}

// Bring the `bar` function into the current module.
use foo::bar;

fn main() {
    bar();
}
```

The syntax for `use` is `use path::to::item;`, where `path::to::item` is as described in
xref:path.adoc[Paths].
The position of the `use` item does not matter (like any other item), but it is recommended to put
them in the beginning of the module.

== Cycles
The `use` item can lead to an import cycle:

```rust
mod foo {
    use super::bar;
}
use foo::bar;
```

In this case, the compiler throws an error.
