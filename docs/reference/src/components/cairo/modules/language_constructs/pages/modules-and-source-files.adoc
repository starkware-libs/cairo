= Modules and crates

Crates and modules are used to organize code into separate namespaces, allowing for easier
management of code and better code reusability.

A module is a named container for
xref:items.adoc[items] such as structs, enums, functions, constants, and traits.

A crate is a single compilation unit. It has a root directory, and a root module defined at the file
`lib.cairo` under this directory.

== Defining a module
A module can be defined in two ways: inlined in the current file or in a separate file.
When a module is defined in a separate file, the file is located according to the module hierarchy.
For example, the module `crate_name::a::b::c` is defined in the file
`<crate_root_dir>/a/b/c.cairo`.

[source,cairo]
----
a.cairo:

// This is a module defined in the current file.
mod foo {
    // ... items ...
}

// This is a module defined in `a/bar.cairo`.
mod bar;
----

== Module hierarchy
The module hierarchy is defined by the module definitions in the source code.
When a module is defined inside another module, it is called a submodule, and it can be referred
to using its name. The module containing the current module is called the parent module, and can be
referred to using the `super` keyword. The root module of a crate has no parent.


== Module scope
Items defined inside a module are directly available within the module.
In particular, items defined at outer modules are not directly available in inner modules, even when
inlined. To refer to an item defined in another module, the item must be either fully qualified or
imported with the xref:use.adoc[`use`] keyword. For more information, see xref:path.adoc[Paths].

[source,cairo]
----
struct A {}
struct B {}

mod foo {
    use super::B;    // Import the struct `B` from the parent module.
    fn bar() {
        A {};        // This is not allowed, because `A` is not in scope.
        super::A {}; // This is allowed, because `super` refers to the parent module.
        B {};        // This is allowed, because `B` is imported.
    }
}
