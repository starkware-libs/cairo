= Type layout

Type layout describes how values of a given type are represented in memory.
It does not define new behavior, but specifies how a type is laid out at the
memory level.

Type layout is useful for:

* Understanding memory usage and performance characteristics.
* Interacting with low-level constructs and external systems.
* Ensuring compatibility across language or ABI boundaries.
* Implementing serialization and deserialization logic.

== Layout properties

A type layout defines the following properties:

* Size of the type in memory.
* Alignment requirements of the type.
* Ordering of fields for composite types.
* Padding inserted to satisfy alignment constraints.

== Composite types

For composite types, the layout is derived from the layouts of their fields.
Field ordering and alignment rules may introduce padding between fields.

== Notes

Type layout is a semantic property of types and does not affect high-level
program logic. Most users do not need to reason about type layout unless they
work close to the memory model or external interfaces.
