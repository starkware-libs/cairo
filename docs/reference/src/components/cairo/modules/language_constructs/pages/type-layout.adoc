= Type layout

Type layout defines the in-memory representation of values of a given type.
It specifies how a value is mapped to memory locations at runtime.

A type layout determines:

* The size of the type in memory.
* The alignment requirements of the type.
* The ordering of fields for composite types.
* Any padding inserted to satisfy alignment constraints.

Type layout is derived from the structure of a type and, for composite types,
from the layouts of the types it contains.

Type layout is independent of program semantics and does not affect control
flow or type checking. It becomes relevant when interacting with low-level
mechanisms such as serialization, ABI boundaries, or external systems.
