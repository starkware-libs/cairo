= Lexical structure

The lexical structure of Cairo defines how source code is broken down into fundamental elements called _tokens_.
This page provides an overview of Cairo's lexical elements and their syntax rules.

== Tokens

Cairo source code is analyzed as a sequence of tokens.
A token is the smallest meaningful unit in a Cairo program.
Tokens are categorized into several types:

* xref:keywords.adoc[Keywords] — Reserved words with special meaning
* xref:identifiers.adoc[Identifiers] — Names for variables, functions, types, and other items
* xref:literal-expressions.adoc[Literals] — Fixed values like numbers, booleans, and short strings
* xref:punctuation.adoc[Punctuation] — Symbols used for syntax structure
* xref:comments.adoc[Comments] — Documentation and code annotations

== Keywords

Cairo has several categories of xref:keywords.adoc[keywords]:

* **Strict keywords** — Can only be used in their correct contexts (e.g., `fn`, `let`, `if`, `match`)
* **Reserved keywords** — Reserved for future use (e.g., `for`, `self`, `super`)
* **Contextual keywords** — Have special meaning only in certain contexts

Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
See the xref:keywords.adoc[keywords page] for a complete list.

== Identifiers

xref:identifiers.adoc[Identifiers] are sequences of alphanumeric characters and underscores used to name language constructs such as variables, functions, types, and modules.

Key rules:
* Must start with a letter or underscore
* Cannot be a keyword
* Cairo is case-sensitive
* A single underscore `_` is not an identifier (used to discard values)

== Literals

xref:literal-expressions.adoc[Literal expressions] directly represent values in source code:

* **Boolean literals**: `true` and `false`
* **Numeric literals**: Decimal (`1234`), hexadecimal (`0x4D2`), and binary (`0b10011010010`)
* **Short string literals**: ASCII strings stored as numeric values (e.g., `'hello'`)

Numeric and short string literals can include type suffixes (e.g., `1234_u32`, `'a'_u8`).

== Punctuation

Cairo uses various xref:punctuation.adoc[punctuation symbols] for syntax structure:

* `;` — Statement terminator
* `:` — Type annotations
* `::` — Path separator
* `.` — Member access
* `->` — Function return type
* `@` — Snapshot operator
* And many more

See the xref:punctuation.adoc[punctuation page] for a complete reference.

== Comments

Cairo supports xref:comments.adoc[line comments] using the `//` syntax:

[source,rust]
----
// This is a line comment
let x = 42;  // Comment after code
----
