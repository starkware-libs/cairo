= Member access expressions

A member access expression is an expression that consists of a primary expression followed by a
dot (.) and an identifier.
The primary expression must have a xref:structs.adoc[struct] type that contains a member with the
identifier as its name.
The type of the member access expression is the type of the member that the identifier refers to.

Example:
[source,cairo]
----
struct Point {
    x: usize,
    y: usize,
}

fn foo(p: Point) -> usize {
    p.x
}
