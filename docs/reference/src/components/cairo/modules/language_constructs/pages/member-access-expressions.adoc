= Member access expressions

A member access expression is an expression that accesses a member (field) of a xref:structs.adoc[struct].

== Syntax

The syntax for member access expressions is:

[source,cairo]
----
expression.member_name
----

where `member_name` is an identifier corresponding to a field name in the struct type.

== Semantics

A member access expression is evaluated by:

1. First evaluating the primary expression (left side of the dot)
2. Then accessing the specified member from the resulting value

The type of the member access expression is the type of the accessed member.

== Examples

Valid examples:

[source,cairo]
----
struct Point {
    x: felt252,
    y: felt252,
}

struct Line {
    start: Point,
    end: Point,
}

fn example() -> felt252 {
    let p = Point { x: 10, y: 20 };
    
    // Basic member access
    let x_val = p.x;                    // felt252
    
    // Member access in expressions
    let sum = p.x + p.y;                // felt252
    
    // Nested struct member access
    let line = Line { 
        start: Point { x: 0, y: 0 },
        end: Point { x: 10, y: 10 }
    };
    let end_x = line.end.x;             // felt252
    
    sum
}
----

Invalid examples (illustrative):

- Accessing non-existent member: `p.z` when `Point` only has `x` and `y`
- Missing dot operator: `px` instead of `p.x`
- Accessing member on non-struct type: `5.field`

NOTE: Tuples in Cairo do not support member access syntax. To access tuple elements, use pattern matching with `let` destructuring: `let (first, second, third) = tuple;`
