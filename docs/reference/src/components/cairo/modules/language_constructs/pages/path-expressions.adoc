= Path expressions

A path expression is a standalone xref:path.adoc[concrete path].
It resolves to one of these items:

* A local variable. In this case the path is a single identifier.
* A xref:constant-items.adoc[constant item].
* A generic const parameter. In this case the path is a single identifier.
  These are still unsupported.
