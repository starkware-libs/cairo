= Match expressions

A match xref:expressions.adoc[expression] is used for pattern matching, it allows you to match a
value against a set of patterns and execute code based on the matching pattern.

== Syntax

A match expression starts with the xref:keywords.adoc[keyword] `match`
followed by an expression and a list of arms.
Each arm begins with a xref:patterns.adoc[pattern] which is followed by the `=>` operator, an
expression, and a comma.
A xref:block-expression.adoc[block expression] is typically used if the logic in the arm is more
than a single expression.
The pattern in a given arm may introduce xref:variables.adoc[variables] that can be used in
expression of the said arm.
If the pattern contains variables that are unused in the expression, then the wildcard `_` can be
used in their place.

== Semantics

A match expression is evaluated by evaluating the expression and then matching the value against
the patterns in the arms in order. The first arm whose pattern matches the value of the expression
is executed and the result of the expression in the arm is returned as the result of the match.
[Note]
====
All the arms that don't break the control flow must evaluate to the same type.
An arm breaks the control flow if it
xref:return-expressions.adoc[returns] or xref:panic.adoc[panics].
====

== Limitations

Currently two kinds of match expression are supported:

=== Match on an Enum.

[source, cairo]
----
match enum_var {
    variant_0(a, b, c) => { /* code */ }
    variant_1(_) => { /* code */ }
    ...
    variant_k(a, c) => { /* code */ }
}
----

Where `enum_var` is an instance of some xref:enums.adoc[enum] and `variant_0``, `variant_1`, ...,
`variant_k`` are all the variants of the said enum, order in the way that they were declared.

=== Match on an felt252.

[source, cairo]
----
match felt_var {
    0 => { /* code */ }
    _ => { /* code */ }
}
----

Where `felt_var` is a xref:felt252-type.adoc[felt252] and the match patters are the
xref:literal-expressions.adoc[literal] '0' and wildcard '_' (which matches any value).
