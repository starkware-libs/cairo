= Assignment statement

An _assignment statement_ moves a value into the specified target.

An assignment statement consists of a xref:lvalue.adoc[lvalue] followed by an
equals sign (=) and an expression.
After the assignment, the value of the `lvalue` is changed to the value of the expression.

== Syntax

[source,cairo]
----
lvalue = expression;
----

For example:

[source,cairo]
----
let mut x = 5;
x = 10;  // Assigns 10 to x

let mut arr = array![1, 2, 3];
arr = array![4, 5, 6];  // Assigns a new array to arr
----

== Assignment as an expression

In Cairo, assignment is an expression, not just a statement.
When used as an expression, an assignment evaluates to the unit type `()`.

This means assignments can be used in contexts where expressions are expected, such as in loops:

[source,cairo]
----
let mut i = 0;
let limit = 10;
while i < limit {
    i = i + 1;  // Assignment returns (), but the side effect updates i
}
----

Or in block expressions, where the assignment provides a side effect:

[source,cairo]
----
let mut x = 5;
// The block's value comes from the final expression (x), not from the assignment
let y = {
    x = 10;  // This assignment returns (), but modifies x
    x        // This is the block's return value
};
// y is 10, x is also 10
----

Note that `x = 10` is an expression that returns `()`, while `x` (the final expression) provides the value `10` that gets assigned to `y`.

== Assignment cannot be chained

Because assignments evaluate to `()`, they cannot be chained like in some other languages:

[source,cairo]
----
let mut x = 0_u32;
let mut y = 0_u32;
x = y = 5;  // Error: cannot assign () to x
----

This fails because:

1. `y = 5` executes first (assignment is right-associative)
2. `y` becomes `5`, and the expression `y = 5` returns `()`
3. Then `x = ()` attempts to execute
4. Type error: cannot assign `()` to a variable of type `u32`

To assign the same value to multiple variables, assign separately:

[source,cairo]
----
let mut x = 0;
let mut y = 0;
let value = 5;
x = value;
y = value;
----
