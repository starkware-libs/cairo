An _assignment statement_ moves a value into the specified target.

An assignment statement consists of an expression identifier, _the assignee operand_, followed by an
equals sign (=) and a value expression, the assigned value operand. The assignee operand must be a
visible local identifier, and the value expression must be of the same type.

The definition of the operand remains the original one, but with a new value.
