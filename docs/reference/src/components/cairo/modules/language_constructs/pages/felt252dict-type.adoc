= Felt252dict

Cairo currently supports a dictionary type called `Felt252Dict` that maps keys of type `felt252`
to other simple types, namely `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `felt252` and `nullable<T>`.
The `nullable<T>` type enables the dictionary to contain more complex types.

By default, the value `0`, or value logically equivalent to `0`, is returned for non-existing keys.

Here is a simple usage example for a dictionary:

[source,rust]
----
let mut dict = Felt252DictTrait::new();
    dict.insert(10, 110);
    dict.insert(11, 111);
    let val10 = dict[10]; // 110
    let val11 = dict[11]; // 111
    let val12 = dict[12]; // 0
    dict.insert(10, 120);
    let val10 = dict[10]; // 120
----

== Dictionary Entry

Reading from a dictionary creates a copy of the value and thus requires the value to implement
the Copy trait. However, dictionaries also support a special type of read access, using the
dictionary `entry` method, which is useful for in-place updates of the dictionary.

To create an entry, call `entry(key)`, which returns the current value of the given key and a
`Felt252DictEntry` object. The `Felt252DictEntry` object is a temporary owner of the dictionary
and can only be destructed by calling `finalize(new_value)` on it. This ensures that the
dictionary is not used while it is being modified.

[source,rust]
----
    let mut dict = Felt252DictTrait::new();
    dict.insert(10, 110);
    let (val10, entry) = dict.entry(10);
    let new_val = do_some_calculation(val10);
    entry.finalize(new_val);
    let val10 = dict[10]; // new_val
----

== Dictionary Destruction

Dictionaries are automatically destroyed when they go out of scope. However, the destruction
process of a dictionary is not trivial, and the `Destruct` trait is implemented for `Felt252Dict``.
This means that `Destruct` must be derived for any type that contains a dictionary. For more
information, see the xref:linear-types.adoc#Destructors[Destructors] section.

[source,rust]
----
    #[derive(Destruct)]
    struct MyStruct {
        dict: Felt252Dict,
    }
