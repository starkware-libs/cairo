= Variables

Variables are defined using the `let` keyword. The syntax for declaring a variable is as follows:

for example:
[source]
----
let x: u32 = 5_u32;
----
declares a variable named x of type u32 (32-bit unsigned integer) with an initial value of 5.

Variables are immutable unless declared otherwise.
A variable can be declared as mutable using the
'mut' keyword.

For example:
[source]
----
let mut x = 17;
----
