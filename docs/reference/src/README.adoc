== Project Build Process
This documentation site is built using Antora.

The Antora documentation site is located at https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/[Antora].

The Antora playbook is located within the `antora-playbook.yml` file.

In order to build the documentation site, you will need to install Node.js and npm. Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install Antora and the Antora command line interface (CLI) using npm:

`npm install`

The static files for the Antora site can be generated using the following commands:

1. `cd` into the UI directory and run `gulp pack` to generate a zip of the theme files for the UI.
2. Navigate to the root directory and run `antora antora-playbook.yml` to generate the static
files for the documentation site within the `public_html` directory.
