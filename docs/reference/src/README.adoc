So you've landed in a strange finite field. Only thing to do now is setup basecamp.

== Overview

Basecamp is a curriculum created to teach the Cairo programming language and StarkNet development.
It is divided by camps and built by the StarkNet community (you!).
Finish the resume and you will conquer the Ethereum world.

== Contributing

Basecamp can be improved and will evolve as StarkNet matures.
Together we are setting up The Basecamp, so there are several sections within the Camps that require Camper input. Camper, your contributions are welcome and needed!
Go to the section https://github.com/starknet-edu/basecamp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md[Contributing].
Here are things you can do to help:

* Empty section in a camp? Go for it!
* Do you think Basecamp needs an additional section? Propose it.
* Can a section be improved? Feel free to modify it.
* Do you want to add an alternative programming language for the examples? Yes please.
* Correct the bugs if you find any.
* Please add an explanation in the exercise comments if you feel they need them.
* Add exercises that show your favorite feature of Cairo.
