## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there are any vulnerabilities in **Cairo**, don't hesitate to _report them_.

1. Use any of the [private contact addresses](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo#support).
2. Describe the vulnerability.

   If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in your message!

3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix has been released!

4. Public disclosure of the vulnerability is permitted at the earliest of the following:
  * Immediately after the fix is released and available to all users, or
  * 90 days after the initial report (if no fix has been released), or
  * 30 days after we officially notify you that we will not fix the vulnerability.

   We will always credit you in any advisory unless you choose to remain anonymous.
